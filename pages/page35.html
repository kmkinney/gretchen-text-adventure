            You quickly and quietly leave the cave, trying to forget everything that happened. You return straight back to your home village and sell all of your armor to buy a large pasture with several sheep to graze in. The salesman threw in a set of reed pipes for your trouble.

        <h3 class="desciption">
            Besides, every time you picture her face, all you can envision are two glittering mandibles.
