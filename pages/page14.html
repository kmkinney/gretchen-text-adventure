            You're happy your love is back, but you definitely suspect that she has been less than loyal to you. You know her kidnapper well, and his face and body (not to mention his perfectly shaped calves and ankles) are the only ones handsome enough to rival yours. Whether or not it's jealousy and insecurity that drive your actions is irrelevant: your lady has a lot to answer for. Even though your lady approaches you with open arms and a joyful smile, you coldly stop her and demand that she prove her virtue and loyalty before she comes any closer. 
The smile drops from your lady's face, and she glares right back at you. Although she doesn't take another step towards you, she reaches out her small, delicate hand to firmly (and painfully) slap you across the face. 
She declares that Sancho Panza is twice the knight you ever were, and that she always knew you were nothing more than a cowardly fool. She hops back on Sancho Panza's horse, wrapping her arms firmly around his waist. Your squire seems surprised, but not unhappy, at this turn of events.
