            As you enter the courtroom, you're starting to feel a little nervous. Your lady is really waiting until the last minute to rescue you. You can't focus on the proceedings. You keep thinking about your head hanging in a noose. Or perhaps rolling away from your body. The tribunal hasn't quite decided which method of execution would be suitable for you.
        </h3>
        <h3 class="desciption">
            When the King asks you to present your defense, you panic and deny everything. You say there never was a lady, and that you just made her up as an excuse to deflect the affections of the Queen.
        </h3>
        <h3 class="desciption">
            The King still doesn't believe that his treasured flower could ever do something so dishonorable. You are sentenced to death. The Queen smiles in satisfaction.
        </h3>
        <h3 class="desciption">
            Your lady never does come, although several people did report seeing a beautiful woman with tears streaming down her cheeks riding away from the castle.
        </h3>
        <h3 class="desciption">
            As it turns out, your executioner sticks with time-honored tradition: you are hanged at high noon.
