            This is not your first encounter with the nefarious sorcerer/wizard/conjurer/enchanter Rocinante; you two have been sworn enemies since infancy (when the two of you would battle to see who could cry the longest and scream the loudest), and he has always tried to thwart your every plan. You are not surprised that your love--your blooming flower of grace, your fountain of virtue-- has been kidnapped by him. You try to contain the rage that builds within you, but you know that you will not rest until Rocinante has paid for his crimes.

           Bravely declare that you will not rest until you have rescued your love and immediately set off on adventure--well, almost immediately. You have to make sure you're adequately prepared, so you compose a few dramatic poems first.

           You're pretty busy taking care of your kingdom, so you send your loyal squire after your lady instead. You're sure he'll do a great job.
