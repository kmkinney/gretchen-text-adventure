            You manage to climb five feet up the wall before you slip and fall into the moat. It happens again, and again, and again. You start to think that maybe you should have focused your training on free climbing instead of on sword-fighting.
        </h3>
        <h3 class="desciption">
            Finally, dripping wet and soaked to the bone, you finally make it all the way up the wall--and stand face-to-face with your enemy. You weakly raise your sword and demand that he reveal your beloved, but you look so pathetic that, instead of fighting you, he just presents your lady to you and leaves.
        </h3>
        <h3 class="desciption">
            You reach out for a hug, but your lady eyes your dripping armor and declines.
        </h3>
        <h3 class="desciption">
The two of you ride home in silence, and you don't even have enough courage to recite the poem you wrote for her. Once you arrive back at your estates, you lady thanks you for rescuing her and, before you can even ask for her hand in marriage, she quickly hops off your horse and walks home.
        </h3>
        <h3 class="desciption">
You're disappointed, but not discouraged. With your lady gone, you're have much more time to write poetry.
