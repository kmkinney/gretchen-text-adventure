            One evening, after a long day patrolling the countryside, 
            you return home to find a squadron of the King's Guard waiting 
            outside your estate. At first you are eager, assuming that the 
            Guard has come to enjoy your generous hospitality, but your 
            hopes are quickly dashed as the Captain of the Guard informs 
            you that he has orders to arrest you for treason and sedition. 
            It seems that someone close to you has accused you of an 
            assasaination plot against the King as well as attempts to 
            incite a rebellion among the populace. You vehemently deny 
            all of these accusations, but the Captain is unwilling to be 
            persuaded. Apparently this mystery informant has no small 
            influence with the King. You are escorted to a prison underneath 
            the castle, awaiting trial. If you are found guilty, the only 
            thing you will have to look forward to will be the executioner's 
            blade. Sitting in the cold, damp cell, you have plenty of time to 
            think about what happened.
