            You saunter into the courtroom, flashing a wink at the Queen. When you're asked to present your defense, you simply explain that your lady is far more beautiful, cultured, and elegant than the Queen could ever be. Strangely enough, the King doesn't seem to be persuaded by any of these arguments.

        <h3 class="desciption">
            The King's jaw drops, and even he has to admit that she is far more beautiful than the Queen.

            You ignore all of this, eager to be reunited with your lady. You rush over to her and hop onto her horse.
        </h3>
        <h3 class="desciption">
            The two of you ride off into the sunset and live happily ever after in Fairyland.
        </h3>
        <h3 class="desciption">
            Or perhaps she assumes her true form as a spider-woman and eats you alive after she takes you back to her underground lair.
        </h3>
        <h3 class="desciption">
            Either way, you were never heard from again.
