        <h3 class="desciption">
            You suggest to your lady that it may be quicker to cut the body down and pick it up from the ground below. Your lady is none too keen on the idea at first, but with a little convincing you persuade her that it is the most surefire way to get her brother a proper burial.
Pulling out your trusty sword, you saw away at the rope holding up his body, and watch it start falling to the ground. You hear a muffled scream, then a loud thump, but the ground is too far away to see clearly.     
        </h3>
        <h3 class="desciption">
            You and your lady rush down the stairs, ignoring the guards who ask you to perform a rendition of your soliloquy from Act 4.
        </h3>
        <h3 class="desciption">
            When you make it to the base of the tower, you discover not one, but two dead bodies. It looks like a soldier patrolling the base of the tower was crushed by the weight of the speeding corpse. Your lady is saddened at the unnecessary death, but not dissuaded from her course; all she does is mention that you may need to dig a deeper hole.
        </h3>
        <h3 class="desciption">
            The two of you get to work digging, and pretty soon you have a seven-foot-deep hole. Your lady says she wants it closer to eight, so you keep digging. Right as you reach about eight feet, you hear the sound of a trumpet. Looking up, you see ten members of the King's Guard standing around the edges of the hole. They don't look happy.
        </h3>
        <h3 class="desciption">
            Your lady tries to defend your actions, but they don't listen. Instead they start piling dirt back into the hole--with you in it.
        </h3>
        <h3 class="desciption">
            The world gets darker and darker and you reach out to hold your lady's hand as the dirt keeps flying in.
        </h3>
        <h3 class="desciption">
            At least her brother will get a proper burial. Alongside you.
