        <h3 class="desciption">
            Dressed all in black, you and your lady sneak into the castle carrying very large shovels and a very large bag. Although you think you're being stealthy, you're noticed by pretty much everyone. Thankfully, you're able to allay suspicions by telling everyone that you are both playing assassins in the upcoming play <i>Hamlet:The Dark Knight Rises.</i>
You eventually find the right tower, and start climbing and climbing and climbing. After a half hour, you decide that if you ever have a castle, you won't put any stairs inside. After another hour, you and your lady finally make it to the top. 
You find your lady's brother's body hanging outside the window as expected. However, the thought of carrying his body down all those stairs sounds pretty unappealing, not to mention the suspicious looks you'll get from the guards if you're carrying around an <i>actual</i> body.

           That you just cut the body off of the windowsill, let it drop down, and pick it up at the bottom.
