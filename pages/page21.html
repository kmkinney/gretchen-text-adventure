            You wait eagerly for the day that your former lady will cross your path again, so you can exact your revenge. The perfect opportunity soon presents itself--you have (perhaps by mistake) received an invitation to your former lady's wedding. You RSVP, but arrive at the chapel early to hide behind the large entrance doors. As soon as you see your lady walk you, your sword flashes out, separating her nose from her face. Your lady screams, and blood flies everywhere.

        <h3 class="desciption">
            You're quickly arrested by several knights, but when you explain your reasoning, they agree that instead of arresting you, they'll send you to the local sanatorium.
        </h3>
        <h3 class="desciption">
            Although you now spend your days in either a straight-jacket or group therapy sessions, you're gratified to learn that your former lady's children are all born without noses.
Besides, the food is pretty good.
