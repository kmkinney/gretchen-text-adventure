        <h3 class="desciption">
            You bravely press forward and enter the cave. It's dark, and you didn't bring a torch, but your love for your lady lights your path. (Metaphorically at least. In reality, the cave is still very, very dark.) You start to hear some strange sounds, almost like screams mixed with the sounds of scuttling insects, but you manage to ignore those. You brush past cobwebs that seem to be getting thicker and thicker.
        </h3>
        <h3 class="desciption">
            Finally, you notice the cave start to get lighter. Eagerly, you speed up, sure that you can hear your lady right around the corner. You race around one final bend only to see something that looks like a woman standing on a spider. After a few more seconds of observation, you realize that the woman's torso connects seamlessly with the spider's body. The woman-creature turns and you see that, instead of a mouth, all she has are mandibles.
        </h3>
        <h3 class="prompt">
            You scream, but the spider-woman doesn't seem to notice. All of her attention is on the screaming knight she already has trapped inside a web.
        </h3>
        <a class="option" href="page36.html">
            You bravely rush forward to rescue the screaming knight.

            You decide that all this adventuring business really isn't for you and quietly back out of the cave.
