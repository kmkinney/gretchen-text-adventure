            Your Lady looks disappointed that you refuse to help her, but what can you do? You're torn between your love for her and your love for your kingdom. Your lady insists on going by herself, even though you try to dissuade her. That night, you sleep fitfully, wondering what horrible fate has befallen your lady.
        </h3>
        <h3 class="desciption">
            In the morning, you rush to the castle to see if your love was successful. What you find breaks your heart; instead of one dead body hanging from the highest tower in the castle, there are now two.
        </h3>
        <h3 class="desciption">
            Broken hearted at the sight of your lady's corpse, you take your sword and thrust it through your heart. A world without your lady isn't a world worth living in.
