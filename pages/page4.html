            Your love is as unchanging as the mountains and loyal until death. 
            She thinks less of herself and more of her duties and responsibilities. 
            Although you're the knight, sometimes it seems like your love is the true hero, 
            preferring to die rather than to betray you or her family. Your love is prepared 
            to do whatever it takes to accomplish her duties. 
        </h3>
        <h3 class="prompt">
            Will you prove yourself as loyal as she?
        </h3>
