            The spider-woman seems excited that you've accepted her invitation. The other knight seems a bit put out that he is no longer playing a lead role, but the spider-woman gently explains that, after so many weeks, his screaming voice is starting to get a little hoarse.
        </h3>
        <h3 class="desciption">
            You don't have much time to learn your lines, but thankfully most of them are just variations on the word "AHHHH."
        </h3>
        <h3 class="desciption">
            For the performance, you don't even have to change costumes! Your armour works perfectly. You're nervous at first, but the giant spider crowd loves you! They can't get enough of your screams of terror.
        </h3>
        <h3 class="desciption">
            One performance follows another, and pretty soon you're hosting autograph and photo sessions. Small giant spiders have posters of you up on their walls, and adult giant spiders are jealous of your popularity with the ladies.
        </h3>
        <h3 class="desciption">
            Somehow, in all the hubbub, you've forgotten your original quest. But, as they say, a new love puts flight to an old one. You've started to get to know the spider-lady (Lilith) better, and, well, aside from the number of legs, the two of you have a lot in common.
        </h3>
        <h3 class="desciption">
            Together, the two of you revolutionize the world of giant-spider theater, living happily ever after.
